    <h1>Easy Rib Eye Roast</h1>
    <p>I make this rib-eye roast on the bone every time rib eyes are on sale. Easy and delicious; there are never any leftovers! We usually cook ours medium-rare.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup softened butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1(4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
        <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Pole several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and season with salt and pepper. Place rib fat-side up in a roasting pan.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue cooking until rib eye is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium.</p>
